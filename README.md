# Cloud-Framework-For-Home-Automation
This project demonstrates a simple home automation system that allows the user to control it with a wireless device such as a Wi-Fi enabled laptop or a high end mobile phone (smart phone). The system allows the user to control each of the lights, fans and power plug points individually. The user can switch On/Off the appliances both locally (i.e. from anywhere in the house using Wi-Fi) and globally (i.e. from anywhere in the world using a mobile phone/laptop and with the help of Internet).
